This is a repository for a Weather Application App. 
In this repository, the user will be able to check the weather for any city they would like to check out. They will be provided the current temperature for that city along with a 5-day forecast for that city.
Along with the temperature, the user will find the conditions, humidity, and wind speed for the current day and 5-day forecast.
The user will also have the ability to access a search history where their searches will be saved in a local storage that will be displayed immediately on their page.
